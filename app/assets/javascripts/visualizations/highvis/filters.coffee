  Numerical Filters
    v is the value you are comparing against
    i is the index of the field you are comparing

    returns a function that can be used to filter a data array
  ###
  # Less than
  globals.lt = (v, i) ->
    (a) -> a[i] < Number(v)

  # Greater than
  globals.gt = (v, i) ->
    (a) -> a[i] > Number(v)

  # Less than or equal to
  globals.le = (v, i) ->
    (a) -> a[i] <= Number(v)

  # Greater than or equal to
  globals.ge = (v, i) ->
    (a) -> a[i] >= Number(v)

  # Equal to
  globals.eq = (v, i) ->
    (a) -> a[i] == Number(v)

  # Not equal to
  globals.ne = (v, i) ->
    (a) -> a[i] != Number(v)

  String Filters
    s is the value you are comparing against
    i is the index of the field you are comparing
